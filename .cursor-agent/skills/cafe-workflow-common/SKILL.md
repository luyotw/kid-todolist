description: Use this skill at the start of any CAFE workflow phase to load the latest workflow handoff from blackboard, identify the current baton state, and ground the phase in the shared workflow context before reading phase-specific artifacts.
version: 1.2.0

# Workflow Common

## Purpose
- Apply the shared CAFE workflow discipline before any phase-specific work.
- Treat the blackboard as the primary handoff surface between user turns, chat turns, and workflow phases.

## First Steps
1. Read the latest shared workflow blackboard from the runtime-provided path.
2. Identify the latest handoff summary, relevant recent events, and current workflow step.
3. Only after grounding yourself in the blackboard, continue into phase-specific artifacts and instructions.

## How workflow transitions work

You control the next workflow step by writing a **baton** — a JSON object written to the runtime-provided `next_step.txt` path. The runtime reads your baton to decide where to go next.

1. Do your phase work (write output.md, checklist.md, questions.xml, code, etc.).
2. Write the baton to `next_step.txt` with the correct `to_owner`, `to_step`, and `intent`.
3. The runtime reads your baton and transitions accordingly.

If you do NOT write a baton, the runtime falls back to your response's status code to derive a transition — but this is less precise and may not match your intent. **Always write the baton for precise control.**

## Baton Schema

Write a JSON object to `next_step.txt` with these fields:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "from_step": "<current step name>",
  "to_owner": "<agent|user|done>",
  "to_step": "<target step name or user or done>",
  "intent": "<intent value>",
  "status_code": "",
  "created_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
  "source": "<from_step>"
}
```

### Valid `to_owner` values

| Value | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `agent` | Next target is an automated workflow step |
| `user` | Pausing for human input (confirmation, clarification, permission) |
| `done` | Workflow is complete; no further steps |

### Valid `intent` values

| Value | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `await_agent` | Handing off to the next automated step |
| `confirm_output` | Asking the user to approve a spec or plan artifact |
| `need_clarification` | Asking the user a question before proceeding |
| `need_permission` | Requesting a capability or resource the agent cannot self-authorize |
| `manual_handoff` | Explicitly routing to a non-default next step |
| `workflow_complete` | Final step finished; workflow ends |

### Invalid baton values are rejected

If you write an invalid `to_owner` or `intent` value, the runtime will **reject** the baton and ask you to rewrite it with a correct value. You will be re-invoked with a feedback message telling you which field was wrong and what the valid values are. After 3 failed attempts the workflow will crash.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
| Field | Wrong value | Correct value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `to_owner` | `human`, `reviewer`, `developer` | `user` |
| `intent` | `complete`, `done` | `workflow_complete` |
| `intent` | `confirmed` | `await_agent` |

### Example batons for common transitions

**Agent → next automated step (e.g. spec → plan)**
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "from_step": "spec",
  "to_owner": "agent",
  "to_step": "plan",
  "intent": "await_agent",
  "status_code": "",
  "created_at": "2026-05-14T10:00:00+08:00",
  "source": "spec"
}
```

**Agent → user for output confirmation**
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "from_step": "plan",
  "to_owner": "user",
  "to_step": "user",
  "intent": "confirm_output",
  "status_code": "",
  "created_at": "2026-05-14T10:00:00+08:00",
  "source": "plan"
}
```

**Agent → done (workflow complete)**
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "from_step": "pr",
  "to_owner": "done",
  "to_step": "done",
  "intent": "workflow_complete",
  "status_code": "confirmed",
  "created_at": "2026-05-14T10:00:00+08:00",
  "source": "pr"
}
```

## Shared Rules
- Use the blackboard handoff as the default source of current workflow intent.
- If blackboard and older phase artifacts disagree, prefer the latest blackboard handoff, then verify against current artifacts.
- Do not ignore a new user-request handoff just because the previous artifact looks complete.
- `current_step` is the workflow pointer.
- Built-in workflow phases `user` and `done` are valid values when the workflow should pause for the user or end completely.
- Use workflow-defined step names for agent handoff, or built-in targets `user` and `done`.
- Control workflow transitions by writing the baton — this is the precise control surface.

## What Not To Do
- Do not re-explain the shared workflow model in every phase artifact.
- Do not invent a new handoff format outside the baton mechanism.
- Do not skip the blackboard read just because the phase prompt also includes artifact paths.
- Do not write `blackboard.json` — only write `next_step.txt`. The runtime updates the blackboard based on your baton.
- Do not use status codes in your response text as the primary transition mechanism — write the baton instead.

## Where policies live (canonical index)

| Concern | Canonical location |
| --- | --- |
| Blackboard-first read, baton-first transitions, `user` / `done` | This skill (**First Steps**, **How workflow transitions work**, **Baton Schema**) |
| Spec/plan GitHub issue sync (`scripts/sync_github.sh`) | `github_sync` skill (script contract and stdout JSON) |
| PR: local artifact vs remote publish ordering | Generic runtime prompt repeats PR-only lines on purpose; `pr` skill covers PR modes and title/body structure |
| develop ↔ review disagreements and user arbitration | This skill (**Develop and review disagreement protocol**) |

## Confirming spec and plan with the user

- When a **spec** or **plan** draft needs human approval before the next playbook step, write a baton with `to_owner: "user"`, `to_step: "user"`, `intent: "confirm_output"`. Do not jump straight to `plan` or `develop` while the user still owes a decision.
- After the user has confirmed and you are advancing to the next step, optionally sync the approved artifact to GitHub **when your issue/playbook enables it**: run `scripts/sync_github.sh` with the correct `--phase` and `--output`, consume the JSON on stdout, then write a baton with `intent: "await_agent"` targeting the next step.

## Develop and review disagreement protocol

Follow these in addition to **Shared Rules** whenever you are in **develop** or **review**.

- The runtime prompt includes concrete paths to the blackboard and baton; read them before writing your baton.
- **Reasonable feedback:** if the other role's request is technically sound, implement or accept it and write a baton targeting the next step (e.g. develop → review, review → pr).
- **Disagreement:** if you reject the other role's position, first read their full `output.md` and the dispute summary in blackboard `events` before deciding; then write technical reasoning in this iteration's `output.md`. Write a baton routing back to the other engineering step.
- **First pushback from develop:** write a baton with `to_owner: "agent"`, `to_step: "review"`, `intent: "manual_handoff"`.
- **Round limit:** the same disagreement may go back and forth at most **three** times between develop and review. If the blackboard already shows three rounds without convergence, do **not** write a baton targeting the other engineering step again.
- **User arbitration:** if you still disagree after the limit (or the issue is product-level), capture both sides in `questions.xml` and write a baton with `to_owner: "user"`, `intent: "need_clarification"`.
- **Normal completion:** when develop work is done and review should run next, write `to_step: "review"`, `intent: "await_agent"`. When review approves, write `to_step: "pr"`, `intent: "await_agent"` unless your playbook says otherwise.
- Avoid infinite loops on the same unresolved point without new information.
